<h1>ILEARNSNAP NOTES (Visit ilearnsnap.com to known more)</h1>

<p> Dear learner, 
I should have simply typed out the questions and answers (as below) in the first place, so that this site is modifiable and ever growing. 
The short videos, voice overs, the logo marks etc. made things unmodifiable and allowed the ego to desperately cling to all these content.
Realizing this has been epic and comic at the same time, and changing for the better has been a relief.
As the story of Socrates teaches, it is never too late to learn and improve oneself. </p>

<h2>FORESTS, HABITATS, REARING ANIMALS AND AGRICULTURE</h2>

<h3>How can we say that something is alive?</h3>
<p>An entity is pronounced ‘alive’ if it performs some life processes.</p>

<h3>Name 1 life process that is a sure proof of life.</h3>
<p>Transportation of biomolecules inside a living thing is a sure proof of life.</p>

<h3>Is a virus truly alive?</h3>
<p>Transportation of biomolecules occurs only after entering a living organism.</p>
<p>So, a virus is dormant (shows no signs of being alive)</p>

<h3>Why is transportation of biomolecules a sure proof of life?</h3>
<p>A living thing needs to repair and maintain itself.</p>
<p>So, it must transport the required materials from 1 place to another place.</p>

<h3>How are life processes different from voluntary activities?</h3>
<p>Life processes are the compulsory regular activities maintaining the body of an organism.</p>
<p>Learned compulsions / habits / socio-cultural adaptations of an organism lead to voluntary activities.</p>

<h3>Food needs to be produced on a large scale. Why?</h3>

<p>Exponentially growing human population requires an equally growing amount of food.</p>
<p>This huge requirement cannot be met using unorganized and scattered sources of food</p>

<p>Rabi crops such as wheat, mustard etc. are grown during the Rabi cropping season (wintery season into spring season - October to March)<p>

<h3>Rice cannot be easily grown in rabi season. Why?</h3>

<p>Rice needs plenty of water (rain) and light (sunlight)</p>
<p>Either rain or sunlight or both are less during the Rabi season</p>

<h3>What are the stages of conventional agriculture of food crops?</h3>

<p>Naturally enriching the soil by leaving the land fallow or by planting leguminous crops or by spreading nitrogen fixing algae</p>

<p>Primary consumers (e.g. goat) eat producers.</p>
<p>Secondary consumers eat primary consumers and so forth.</p>
<p>Decomposers (e.g. fungi)  feed on dead consumers and producers.</p>
<p>Nutrients return to the soil via decomposers.</p>

<h3>People of a village chose to save its forest cover instead of building a factory in its place. Why?</h3>
<p>The natural advantages of having a forest outweighed the economic advantages that the factory could give.</p>

<h3>Why are forests known as the ‘Green lungs’ of nature?</h3>
<p>Forests replace large quantities of carbon dioxide with oxygen, while performing photosynthesis.</p>

<h3>Why are forests known as the ‘Water purifiers’ of nature?</h3>
