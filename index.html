<h1>ILEARNSNAP NOTES (Visit ilearnsnap.com to known more)</h1>

<p> Dear learner, 
I should have simply typed out the questions and answers (as below) in the first place, so that this site is modifiable and ever growing. 
The short videos, voice overs, the logo marks etc. made things unmodifiable and allowed the ego to desperately cling to all these content.
Realizing this has been epic and comic at the same time, and changing for the better has been a relief.
As the story of Socrates teaches, it is never too late to learn and improve oneself. </p>

<h2>FORESTS, PLANTS, REARING ANIMALS AND AGRICULTURE</h2>

<h3>Food needs to be produced on a large scale. Why?</h3>

<p>Exponentially growing human population requires an equally growing amount of food.</p>
<p>This huge requirement cannot be met using unorganized and scattered sources of food</p>

<h3>What is a crop?</h3>

<p>Crop is a plant grown on a large scale under controlled conditions to obtain resources such as food, fibres etc.<p>

<h3>What are the cropping seasons of India?</h3>

<p>Kharif crops such as rice, millet etc. are grown during the Kharif cropping season (rainy season - June to September)</p>
<p>Rabi crops such as wheat, mustard etc. are grown during the Rabi cropping season (wintery season into spring season - October to March)<p>

<h3>Rice cannot be easily grown in rabi season. Why?</h3>

<p>Rice needs plenty of water (rain) and light (sunlight)</p>
<p>Either rain or sunlight or both are less during the Rabi season</p>

<h3>What are the stages of conventional agriculture of food crops?</h3>

<p>Naturally enriching the soil by leaving the land fallow or by planting leguminous crops or by spreading nitrogen fixing algae</p>
<p>Aeration of soil by ploughing and sprinkling water</p>
<p>Sowing the seeds under the soil</p>
<p>Adding manure or fertilizer</p>
<p>Irrigation</p>
<p>Removing weeds or spraying weedicides</p>
<p>Spraying pesticides</p>
<p>Harvesting the crop</p>
<p>Threshing</p>
<p>Winnowing</p>
<p>Packing and storage</p>

<h3>Why is natural enrichment of soil important?</h3>

<p>Soil loses its ability to enrich itself naturally due to intensive agriculture and excess use of fertilizers.</p>
<p>We must facilitate soil microbes, earthworms and natural formation of humus.</p>

<h3>What are leguminous crops?</h3>

<p>Leguminous crops have root nodules containing nitrogen fixing bacteria</p>

<h3>What do you mean by leaving the land fallow?</h3>

<p>Land is left untouched and uncultivated</p>

<h3>Explain the nutrient cycle in a self sustaining rainforest.</h3>

<p>Producers (e.g. green plants) absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Primary consumers (e.g. goat) eat producers.</p>
<p>Secondary consumers eat primary consumers and so forth.</p>
<p>Decomposers (e.g. fungi)  feed on dead consumers and producers.</p>
<p>Nutrients return to the soil via decomposers.</p>

<h3>Conventional agriculture disrupts the nutrient cycle occurring naturally. Explain.</h3>

<p>Conventional intensive agriculture uses a lot of soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Excess use of fertilizers in lieu of natural enrichment.</p>
<p>This destroys the useful soil microbes and worms, stopping the self sustaining nutrient cycle.</p>

<h3>Why is ploughing the field important?</h3>

<p>Ploughing involves:</p>
<p>Breaking larger clumps of soil</p>
<p>Turning the soil to obtain a well aerated uniform soil texture</p>
<p>Making furrows for sowing and irrigation</p>

<h3>List some traditional hand-held farming tools.</h3>

<p>Sickle, hoe, shovel, pruning saw, khurpi, plough, axe, rake</p>

<h3>Describe the ideal qualities of seeds used for agriculture.</h3>

<p>Ideal properties of seeds:</p>
<p>Healthy and alive</p>
<p>High yielding</p>
<p>Disease and pest resistant</p>
<p>Require less inputs (e.g. water)</p>
<p>High nutrient content in the yield</p>
<p>Fast growth</p>

<h3>What do you mean by fodder?</h3>

<p>Food given to domestic herbivores like cow, goat, sheep etc.<p>

<h3>What kind of fodder is given to sheep?</h3>

<p>Sheep graze on grass and leaves</p>
<p>They are given pulses, corn, oil cakes, jowar and minerals</p>
<p>During winter they are provided grass, leaves, dry fodder and grains, indoors</p>


<h2>HUMAN FOOD</h2>

<h3>What do you mean by ingredients of food items?</h3>

<p>Items used to make a food item are called ingredients</p>

<h3>What are the main sources of ingredients?</h3>

<p>Plants and animals are the main sources of ingredients.</p>

<h3>Give an example of ingredients used to make tea.</h3>

<p>Plants and animals are the main sources of ingredients.</p>

<h3>List the parts of plant eaten as food with examples.</h3>

<p>Root (Sweet potato)</p>
<p>Stem (Potato)</p>
<p>Leaf (Spinach)</p>
<p>Flower (Cauliflower)</p>
<p>Fruit (Apple)</p>
<p>Fruit vegetable (Eggplant/Brinjal)</p>
<p>Cereals (Rice)</p>
<p>Pulses (Kidney beans)</p>
<p>Beverages (Tea)</p>
<p>Spices (Cardamom)</p>

<p>We kill animals like goat and hen for meat</p>
<p>We take away eggs from a animals like hen and duck</p>
<p>We take milk from a mother cow or mother buffalo</p>
<p>We break hives of honeybees to take away their stored honey</p>
